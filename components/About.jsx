                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I have about 10years of experience in IT Infrastructure solutions designing/architecting for a local Solutions Integrator.
                My love for tech has stemmed from my father showing me this thing called the "Atari" console which piqued my curiosity on how things work.
                Since then, I knew I had to be involved with the IT industry one way or another. 
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>Programming to me is like solving little puzzles and that the computer does whatever I tell it to that's why I always found it fun to do. 
                    Funny how life works somehow though, after graduating, I got into IT Infrastructure with little to no programming whatsoever.
                    Now back into the groove of programming and getting exposed to Crypto and Web3, I know I have to learn about it and be a part of it. 
                    I started my programming journey again by making Discord Bots and eventually integrating Web3 tech into it. 
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>Branching out to Web3 DAPPs, my current skillset is focused on Solidity Smart Contracts and DAPPs on Ethereum and trying to spend a little more time
                    learning about RUST and Solana ecosystem. Learning never stops that's why I also want to be involved in projects that are highly experimental
                    as I believe that the Web3 Space is still growing and a lot more innovation will come from those who start now. ðŸ˜Ž
